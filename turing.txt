How to Hire Remote Software Developers Hiring remote software developers is a challenging task for any company, especially in today’s competitive and dynamic market. Remote software developers are in high demand, but finding, hiring, and managing them can be difficult and time-consuming. Here are some tips on how to hire remote software developers effectively and efficiently:
* Define your requirements: Before you start looking for remote software developers, you need to have a clear idea of what kind of skills, experience, and personality you are looking for.

You can use various methods to vet the candidates, such as resume screening, portfolio review, coding tests, video interviews, reference checks, etc. You also need to assess their communication skills, work ethic, and cultural fit.
* Hire the best: After you have vetted the candidates, you need to make the final hiring decision based on your evaluation and intuition. You need to consider not only the technical skills and experience of the candidates, but also their passion, motivation, and potential. You also need to offer them a competitive and fair compensation package that reflects their value and market rate.
* Manage the team: Hiring remote software developers is not the end of the process. You also need to manage them effectively and efficiently to ensure that they deliver high-quality work on time and on budget.

Turing Announces the Launch of Turing Services
Turing
Today, every company is a software company, whether they realize it or not. The traditional IT services model wasn’t built for a software-first world. Why? Traditional IT services mean three things: 1. slow response 2. shallow vetting 3. compromise on the best solution for your business.
Owing to this, companies are looking for alternatives to IT service firms that can meet their software-driven needs.
What if your IT services were powered by a software-driven Talent Cloud?
Enter the new standard in tech services for your business, powered by the Talent Cloud: Turing Services.
What are Turing Services?
